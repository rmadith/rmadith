## Headline
MS Electrical and Computer Engineering student advancing RISC-V compute, FPGA-accelerated graph intelligence, and production ML systems that bridge silicon and software.

## Education
- **Georgia Institute of Technology** — M.S. Electrical and Computer Engineering (Aug 2024 – Dec 2026), Atlanta, GA
- **University of Wisconsin–Madison** — B.S. Computer Engineering (Aug 2021 – May 2024), Madison, WI

## Experience
- **Tenstorrent — RISC-V Cores Intern (Jan 2025 – Aug 2025, Austin, TX)**
  - Brought up the Ascalon single-core design on an emulation platform while optimizing hardware resource utilization.
  - Built a custom Linux kernel with OpenSBI and UART polling to accelerate bring-up of embedded workloads.
  - Tuned DOOM rendering pipelines in C++ with frame-buffer and memory-efficient data structures for higher FPS on constrained systems.
  - Authored C++/SystemVerilog testbenches that validated customer memory subsystems and uncovered pre-silicon bugs.
- **Georgia Institute of Technology — Researcher (Sept 2024 – Jan 2025, Atlanta, GA)**
  - Enhanced GNNBuilder to convert graph neural networks into FPGA implementations that deliver higher inference throughput.
  - Profiled and debugged Xilinx Vitis HLS designs to eliminate deadlocks, caching faults, and logic bottlenecks.
  - Experimented with pipelining, caching, and out-of-order execution strategies to accelerate state-of-the-art GNN workloads.
- **Elvo AI — Software Engineer (Sept 2024 – Jan 2025, San Francisco, CA)**
  - Architected and delivered an AWS-backed infrastructure stack with secure auth, observability, and autoscaling foundations.
  - Delivered the initial Next.js product experience, then rebuilt it as a mobile-first Expo application with shared component libraries.
  - Designed ML pipelines and automated agentic workflows that improved operational efficiency by 30%.
- **University of Wisconsin–Madison — Undergraduate Student Researcher (Mar 2023 – May 2024, Madison, WI)**
  - Built a 10 MHz (±25 Hz) digital modulator/demodulator for an IARPA-sponsored communications project.
  - Implemented pipelined ASK, BPSK, and MFSK hardware modulation targeting RF antenna systems.
  - Hardened FPGA designs for tighter clock stability and delivered higher-fidelity digital PWM control.

## Projects
- **Embedded ML Inference System (May 2024 – Aug 2024)** — Designed a custom SystemVerilog RISC-V CPU with ML-specific instructions, integrated camera/peripheral drivers, and achieved a 30% Imagenet inference speedup over a baseline core.
