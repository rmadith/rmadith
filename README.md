## Headline
MS Electrical and Computer Engineering student advancing RISC-V compute, FPGA-accelerated graph intelligence, and production ML systems that bridge silicon and software.

## Overview
- Monochrome, Space Grotesk aesthetic hosted with GitHub Pages at [https://rmadith.github.io/](https://rmadith.github.io/) to echo a web3-meets-ECE vibe.
- Mobile-first layout that stacks sections cleanly on phones, then expands into multi-column cards with evenly padded panels.
- Consistent contrast, spacing, and metadata treatments across experience, projects, education, and skills for easy scanning.

## Live Portfolio
To keep the site fresh, ensure GitHub Pages is enabled for the `main` branch and the publishing source points to the `/docs` directory where the static assets live. The page mirrors the resume content below while highlighting flagship RISC-V, FPGA, and embedded ML projects.

## Education
- **Georgia Institute of Technology** — M.S. Electrical and Computer Engineering (Aug 2024 – Dec 2026), Atlanta, GA

  - Brought up the Ascalon single-core design on an emulation platform while optimizing hardware resource utilization.
  - Built a custom Linux kernel with OpenSBI and UART polling to accelerate bring-up of embedded workloads.
  - Tuned DOOM rendering pipelines in C++ with frame-buffer and memory-efficient data structures for higher FPS on constrained systems.
  - Authored C++/SystemVerilog testbenches that validated customer memory subsystems and uncovered pre-silicon bugs.
- **Georgia Institute of Technology — Researcher (Sept 2024 – Jan 2025, Atlanta, GA)**
  - Enhanced GNNBuilder to convert graph neural networks into FPGA implementations that deliver higher inference throughput.
  - Profiled and debugged Xilinx Vitis HLS designs to eliminate deadlocks, caching faults, and logic bottlenecks.
  - Experimented with pipelining, caching, and out-of-order execution strategies to accelerate state-of-the-art GNN workloads.
- **Elvo AI — Software Engineer (Sept 2024 – Jan 2025, San Francisco, CA)**
  - Architected and delivered an AWS-backed infrastructure stack with secure auth, observability, and autoscaling foundations.
  - Delivered the initial Next.js product experience, then rebuilt it as a mobile-first Expo application with shared component libraries.
  - Designed ML pipelines and automated agentic workflows that improved operational efficiency by 30%.
- **University of Wisconsin–Madison — Undergraduate Student Researcher (Mar 2023 – May 2024, Madison, WI)**
  - Built a 10 MHz (±25 Hz) digital modulator/demodulator for an IARPA-sponsored communications project.
  - Implemented pipelined ASK, BPSK, and MFSK hardware modulation targeting RF antenna systems.
  - Hardened FPGA designs for tighter clock stability and delivered higher-fidelity digital PWM control.

## Projects
- **Embedded ML Inference System (May 2024 – Aug 2024)** — Designed a custom SystemVerilog RISC-V CPU with ML-specific instructions, integrated camera/peripheral drivers, and achieved a 30% Imagenet inference speedup over a baseline core.
- **Tanks! (Jan 2024 – May 2024)** — Built an embedded C game targeting a five-stage RISC-V pipeline with interrupts, dynamic branch prediction, and a handcrafted VGA graphics engine. [GitHub](https://github.com/rmadith/554)
